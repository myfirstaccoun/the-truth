        <div class="part">
            Hello everyone, I hope you will read this article to the end because it's very important. Let's jump on it.

            <br><br>
            <h1>Part 1: There must be a God</h1>
            Let us agree that anything that happens has a cause. For example, if someone hits you, you'll feel pain. Based on this, we conclude that every created thing has a Creator, every machine has a creator, every house was built by a creator, and the universe has God. This is because anything that happens has a cause.<br><br>

            If you think that the universe was created by the big bang, you are wrong. When you say that the start of the universe is a very small thing, then you haven't answered the question "Who created this small thing?" And the answer is absolutely God. God must be perfect to create the universe alone, and there is no similarity to Him, and no one is similar to Him because God created us and all the creativity in the universe. You must worship Him alone because He created you. If you believe that we are created by chance by evolution, you are wrong because...

            <h1>Part 2: Evolution</h1>
            First, I want you to know that the universe is finely tuned, and chance cannot create this tuned universe. Second, let us know the four pillars of evolution theory.<br><br>

            <h3>Theory pillars</h3>
            1. Living organisms were born in some way from inanimate objects.
            2. Nature endows organisms with new characteristics that can transform them from one species to another.
            3. Acquired traits are inherited, and nature selects cumulatively up to higher beings.
            4. Nature installs complex vital systems of successive simple changes.<br><br>

            The conclusion is that living beings are "evolved" without the intent or will of a chosen or willing creator who knows what he is doing.<br><br>

            Let us make sure of these pillars.<br><br>

            <h3>Make sure</h3>
            1. Living organisms were born in some way from inanimate objects.<br>
            This is a myth that fell through experiments, the most famous of which was Francesco Redi's experiment, two centuries before Darwin. He proved that the organisms that were believed to have been self-generated from inanimate objects such as leftovers came from outside the material, food with polluted air.<br><br>

            The truth is that self-generation is originally illogical. It is impossible to imagine a living being that arises automatically from inanimate objects. But they insisted on trying! They tried, and the superstition was destroyed by empirical science and the mind.<br><br>


            2. Nature endows the organism with new characteristics:<br>
            This is also a myth that fell with the discoveries of Gregor Mendel, who proved - years after Darwin - that the hereditary characteristics of children will not deviate from what was originally in the parents. It also fell with the discoveries of epigenetics, which showed that external and environmental factors can change the way genetic material is read in an organism to activate a trait or to extinguish a trait that was activated, but does not add genetic material that was not originally present.<br><br>


            3. Acquired traits are inherited, and nature selects cumulatively up to higher beings:<br>
            As you guess, this is also a fallen myth. The muscles of the blacksmith and the carpenter, for example, are not inherited by their children. However, Darwin's followers insisted on trying. Weismann kept cutting the tails of 19 generations of rats, only to be surprised, after a long toil, by the birth of their offspring with tails again. This means that the acquired trait, which is the severed tail, was not passed on to the children.<br><br>

            What is left of Darwin's theory then?<br><br>

            4. Nature installs complex vital systems of successive simple changes.<br>
            Until you understand what Darwin's natural selection means? Darwin's vast imagination brought him the idea that nature, use and neglect; Ancient organisms produced simple bodily structures that could have served the organism in something, so natural selection preserved them. Who did not know that the accumulation of these structures would produce a complete and integrated organ such as a wing for a bird or an eye for an animal?<br><br>

            <h2>Story</h2>

            To understand Darwin's logic, imagine a land full of junk. Large numbers of blind people pass through it, and each of them picks up a piece of junk at random. Then, they enter a large building whose door is closed after each entry.<br><br>

            <img src="./junk.png">

            Millions of years passed, and the blind picked up the scraps, died, and were buried under the ground of the building.<br>
            One day, you opened the gate of the building, and a giant Boeing plane, driven by a blind man, rushed out of the gate and flew into the sky!<br>

            <img src="./air plane.png">

            You wondered: How did the blind man build the plane?! It was said to you: He did not intend to make it! But what happened with the blind before him is that whoever picks up a useful piece of scrap for him; he stood firm and bequeathed it to his successor! Some of them picked up a cloth to protect them from the cold; another picked a flat iron to shade them from the sun, and a third picked up a plane steering wheel with which they stirred their food while cooking, and a fourth picked a bottle that they used as a shield in their war against their blind enemies!<br><br>

            This continued in successive times, and they bequeathed their pieces to those who succeeded them, and the pieces were installed unintentionally, nor by an active action until this great plane that I saw was formed from it!<br><br>

            So, beware of the delusion that someone intended for an airplane to form or fly!<br><br>
            By the same reasoning, Darwin considered that natural selection has blindly patched up the structures of organisms. For example, the wings of birds to help them fly are a "pseudopurpose". It means an imaginary goal, not a real one! And the eye is an imaginary target because there is no chosen willful doer who intended for the eye to see, or for the wing to flutter. Rather, all of this came with accumulations of blind coincidences!<br>

            This is the joke of blind natural selection that Darwin came up with, and it is - in addition to its absurdity for every healthy mind - that scientific discoveries have proven their impossibility with the existence of irreducible complexity in all the details of organisms and their relationships. That is, the structures and members of living organisms are extremely complex and integrated so that they can only exist with the availability of their parts at one time. Otherwise, they will not perform their function. Thus, they are not amenable to the idea of gradual formation at all, even at the level of the smallest living unit.<br><br>

            Darwin did not see the cell under the microscope in his days except as a simple smear!<br><br>

            Natural selection as portrayed by Darwin is also a myth.<br><br>

            Based on these baseless superstitions of reason, sense, and experience, Darwin built the most absurd and stupid idea in history. All that we see of judgment and mastery in this creation came by chance without intention and does not need knowledge or wisdom!<br><br>

            After seeing the invalidity of this theory, you must trust that the universe cannot be created by chance and also trust that "there must be a God".<br><br>

            <h1>Part 3: Finding the Right Religion</h1>
            Let us agree that any religion made by humans is wrong because religion must be from God, and the right religion must not have been misrepresented. We now have three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.<br><br>

            ðŸ”· First is Judaism:<br>
            To be Jewish, you must be from the family of them. Absolutely, this religion is void because it's not fair if you want to worship God who created you and cannot do that because you are not from their family.<br><br>

            ðŸ”· Second is Christianity:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>In Christianity, you must believe that God is three Gods: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This idea about God was made by some priests, but how does there exist three Gods? If Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are Gods, then they can control the universe. But the Son is human, and humans cannot control the universe.</li><br>
                <li>The holy book of Christianity is the Bible, and the Bible has been misrepresented by humans. I hope you read about "copies" of the Bible and its contradictions and there are many translations of the Bible, although the Hebrew text is the same. For example, When was David's age when ruling? Was it 1, 30, or 40?</li><br>
                <li>If the Father wants someone to die at 4, and the Son wants that person to die at 5, then what happens? Will that person die at 4 or 5? If the answer is 4, then the Son isn't God. If the answer is 5, then the Father isn't God because God must be able to control the universe.</li><br>
                <li>In Christianity, there is a derogation from God. There is a story that tells that Jacob fought God, and he was going to kill him. But we agreed that God must be perfect for Him alone, and God strongest in the entire universe because God created the universe.</li><br><br>
                
                <li>Fifth reason is:</li><br>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>In Christianity, God sent Jesus down to Earth to be crucified to expiate Adam's sin. But who committed sin? Adam or Jesus? What is the sin of Jesus to be crucified, and who committed the sin, Adam?</li><br>
                    <li>In Christianity, Jesus was crucified to expiate sin on behalf of Adam. And who came after Jesus but died before the death of Jesus died in sin! What is the sin of those who came before Jesus to die in sin, and why didn't Jesus come down before that to expiate the sins of more people?</li><br>
                    <li>Where did Jesus say, "I am God"? Where did he seek worship for himself? Where did he say, "I am God appearing in the flesh"? Where did he talk about original sin? Where did he say, "I am God the Son"? Where did he say, "I am God the Word"? And where did he say, "I am God, the second person"?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <br><br>
            Now we have the final religion, which is Islam. But before you continue reading or listening, don't trust the media and films because they will not disclose the full truth of Islam. They only distort the image of Islam in your brain. Don't trust them. Search for the truth yourself, and let's jump into it.

        <div class="part">
            <h1>Part 4: Are You Really Know Islam?</h1>
            Islam is a religion that commands you to worship Allah, the one God, with no partner and obey his prophet Mohammed - Peace be upon him.<br>
            To be a Muslim, you say the two testimonies:<br>
            Ø£Ø´Ù‡Ø¯ Ø£Ù† Ù„Ø§ Ø¥Ù„Ù‡ Ø¥Ù„Ø§ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡ ÙˆØ£Ø´Ù‡Ø¯ Ø£Ù† Ù…Ø­Ù…Ø¯Ø§ Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯Ù‡ ÙˆØ±Ø³ÙˆÙ„Ù‡.<br>
            which means: "I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Mohammed is His Prophet and Messenger."<br><br>

            Islam is the religion that agrees with human nature. It's the religion that calls for worshipping the one God who is Allah.<br><br>

            Allah is the God of all the universe. Allah is perfect for Him alone, and there is no similarity to Him, and no one is similar to Him. You must worship Him alone.<br><br>

            Now let us know the pillars of Islam that make you Muslim:<br>
            1. Two testimonies<br>
            2. The five Prayers<br>
            3. Paying Zakat<br>
            4. Fasting in Ramadan<br>
            5. Hajj<br><br>

            First is Two testimonies, which you heard before.<br><br>

            Second is Prayer, which is the most important pillar after the Two testimonies. Prayer is a link between you and Allah. The five Prayers are Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghreb, and Ishaa.<br><br>

            Third is paying Zakat, which is an amount of money you pay to eight types of people, including the poor, needy, those who connect Zakat from people, and others. You pay money yearly.<br><br>

            Fourth is Fasting in Ramadan. Ramadan is a Hijri Month when you must stop eating and drinking from Fajr to Maghreb and where there is a night called Night of Al-Qadr. Whoever wins it is better for him than a thousand months.
