        <div class="part">
            Hello everyone, I hope you will read this article to the end because it's very important. Let's jump on it.

            <br><br>
            <h1>Part 1: There must be a God</h1>
            Let us agree that anything that happens has a cause. For example, if someone hits you, you'll feel pain. Based on this, we conclude that every created thing has a Creator, every machine has a creator, every house was built by a creator, and the universe has God. This is because anything that happens has a cause.<br><br>
            
            <img src="./universe.png">
            
            If you think that the universe was created by the big bang, you are wrong. When you say that the start of the universe is a very small thing, then you haven't answered the question "Who created this small thing?" And the answer is absolutely God. God must be perfect to create the universe alone, and there is no similarity to Him, and no one is similar to Him because God created us and all the creativity in the universe. You must worship Him alone because He created you. If you believe that we are created by chance by evolution, you are wrong because...

        <div class="part">
            <h1>Part 2: Evolution</h1>
            First, I want you to know that the universe is finely tuned, and chance cannot create this tuned universe. Second, let us know the four pillars of evolution theory.<br><br>

            <h3>Theory pillars</h3>
            1. Living organisms were born in some way from inanimate objects.<br>
            2. Nature endows organisms with new characteristics that can transform them from one species to another.<br>
            3. Acquired traits are inherited, and nature selects cumulatively up to higher beings.<br>
            4. Nature installs complex vital systems of successive simple changes.<br><br>

            The conclusion is that living beings are "evolved" without the intent or will of a chosen or willing creator who knows what he is doing.<br><br>

            Let us make sure of these pillars.<br><br>

            <h3>Make sure</h3>
            1. Living organisms were born in some way from inanimate objects.<br>
            This is a myth that fell through experiments, the most famous of which was Francesco Redi's experiment, two centuries before Darwin. He proved that the organisms that were believed to have been self-generated from inanimate objects such as leftovers came from outside the material, food with polluted air.<br><br>

            The truth is that self-generation is originally illogical. It is impossible to imagine a living being that arises automatically from inanimate objects. But they insisted on trying! They tried, and the superstition was destroyed by empirical science and the mind.<br><br>


            2. Nature endows the organism with new characteristics:<br>
            This is also a myth that fell with the discoveries of Gregor Mendel, who proved - years after Darwin - that the hereditary characteristics of children will not deviate from what was originally in the parents. It also fell with the discoveries of epigenetics, which showed that external and environmental factors can change the way genetic material is read in an organism to activate a trait or to extinguish a trait that was activated, but does not add genetic material that was not originally present.<br><br>


            3. Acquired traits are inherited, and nature selects cumulatively up to higher beings:<br>
            As you guess, this is also a fallen myth. The muscles of the blacksmith and the carpenter, for example, are not inherited by their children. However, Darwin's followers insisted on trying. Weismann kept cutting the tails of 19 generations of rats, only to be surprised, after a long toil, by the birth of their offspring with tails again. This means that the acquired trait, which is the severed tail, was not passed on to the children.<br><br>

            What is left of Darwin's theory then?<br><br>

            4. Nature installs complex vital systems of successive simple changes.<br>
            Until you understand what Darwin's natural selection means? Darwin's vast imagination brought him the idea that nature, use and neglect; Ancient organisms produced simple bodily structures that could have served the organism in something, so natural selection preserved them. Who did not know that the accumulation of these structures would produce a complete and integrated organ such as a wing for a bird or an eye for an animal?<br><br>

            <h2>Story</h2>

            To understand Darwin's logic, imagine a land full of junk. Large numbers of blind people pass through it, and each of them picks up a piece of junk at random. Then, they enter a large building whose door is closed after each entry.<br><br>

            <img src="./junk.png">

            Millions of years passed, and the blind picked up the scraps, died, and were buried under the ground of the building.<br>
            One day, you opened the gate of the building, and a giant Boeing plane, driven by a blind man, rushed out of the gate and flew into the sky!<br>

            <img src="./air plane.png">

            You wondered: How did the blind man build the plane?! It was said to you: He did not intend to make it! But what happened with the blind before him is that whoever picks up a useful piece of scrap for him; he stood firm and bequeathed it to his successor! Some of them picked up a cloth to protect them from the cold; another picked a flat iron to shade them from the sun, and a third picked up a plane steering wheel with which they stirred their food while cooking, and a fourth picked a bottle that they used as a shield in their war against their blind enemies!<br><br>

            This continued in successive times, and they bequeathed their pieces to those who succeeded them, and the pieces were installed unintentionally, nor by an active action until this great plane that I saw was formed from it!<br><br>

            So, beware of the delusion that someone intended for an airplane to form or fly!<br><br>
            By the same reasoning, Darwin considered that natural selection has blindly patched up the structures of organisms. For example, the wings of birds to help them fly are a "pseudopurpose". It means an imaginary goal, not a real one! And the eye is an imaginary target because there is no chosen willful doer who intended for the eye to see, or for the wing to flutter. Rather, all of this came with accumulations of blind coincidences!<br>

            This is the joke of blind natural selection that Darwin came up with, and it is - in addition to its absurdity for every healthy mind - that scientific discoveries have proven their impossibility with the existence of irreducible complexity in all the details of organisms and their relationships. That is, the structures and members of living organisms are extremely complex and integrated so that they can only exist with the availability of their parts at one time. Otherwise, they will not perform their function. Thus, they are not amenable to the idea of gradual formation at all, even at the level of the smallest living unit.<br><br>

            Darwin did not see the cell under the microscope in his days except as a simple smear!<br><br>

            Natural selection as portrayed by Darwin is also a myth.<br><br>

            Based on these baseless superstitions of reason, sense, and experience, Darwin built the most absurd and stupid idea in history. All that we see of judgment and mastery in this creation came by chance without intention and does not need knowledge or wisdom!<br><br>

            After seeing the invalidity of this theory, you must trust that the universe cannot be created by chance and also trust that "there must be a God".<br><br>

            <h1>Part 3: Finding the Right Religion</h1>
            Let us agree that any religion made by humans is wrong because religion must be from God, and the right religion must not have been misrepresented. We now have three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.<br><br>

            🔷 First is Judaism:<br>
            To be Jewish, you must be from the family of them. Absolutely, this religion is void because it's not fair if you want to worship God who created you and cannot do that because you are not from their family.<br><br>

            🔷 Second is Christianity:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>In Christianity, you must believe that God is three Gods: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This idea about God was made by some priests, but how does there exist three Gods? If Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are Gods, then they can control the universe. But the Son is human, and humans cannot control the universe.</li><br>
                <li>The holy book of Christianity is the Bible, and the Bible has been misrepresented by humans. I hope you read about "copies" of the Bible and its contradictions and there are many translations of the Bible, although the Hebrew text is the same. For example, When was David's age when ruling? Was it 1, 30, or 40?</li><br>
                <li>If the Father wants someone to die at 4, and the Son wants that person to die at 5, then what happens? Will that person die at 4 or 5? If the answer is 4, then the Son isn't God. If the answer is 5, then the Father isn't God because God must be able to control the universe.</li><br>
                <li>In Christianity, there is a derogation from God. There is a story that tells that Jacob fought God, and he was going to kill him. But we agreed that God must be perfect for Him alone, and God strongest in the entire universe because God created the universe.</li><br><br>
                
                <li>Fifth reason is:</li><br>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>In Christianity, God sent Jesus down to Earth to be crucified to expiate Adam's sin. But who committed sin? Adam or Jesus? What is the sin of Jesus to be crucified, and who committed the sin, Adam?</li><br>
                    <li>In Christianity, Jesus was crucified to expiate sin on behalf of Adam. And who came after Jesus but died before the death of Jesus died in sin! What is the sin of those who came before Jesus to die in sin, and why didn't Jesus come down before that to expiate the sins of more people?</li><br>
                    <li>Where did Jesus say, "I am God"? Where did he seek worship for himself? Where did he say, "I am God appearing in the flesh"? Where did he talk about original sin? Where did he say, "I am God the Son"? Where did he say, "I am God the Word"? And where did he say, "I am God, the second person"?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            Now we have the final religion, which is Islam. But before you continue reading or listening, don't trust the media and films because they will not disclose the full truth of Islam. They only distort the image of Islam in your brain. Don't trust them. Search for the truth yourself, and let's jump into it.

        <div class="part">
            <h1>Part 4: Are You Really Know Islam?</h1>
            Islam is a religion that commands you to worship Allah, the one God, with no partner and obey his prophet Mohammed - Peace be upon him -.<br>
            To be a Muslim, you say the two testimonies:<br>
            أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وأشهد أن محمدا عبده ورسوله ('ashhad 'an la 'iilah 'iilaa allah wa'ashhad 'ana muhamadan eabduh warasuluhu).<br>
            which means: "I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Mohammed is His Prophet and Messenger."<br><br>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JbKdKS9Yyg">Learn More about Prophet Mohammed - peace be upon him - [Video - En Subtitles]</a><br><br>

            Islam is the religion that agrees with human nature. It's the religion that calls for worshipping the one God who is Allah.<br><br>

            Allah is the God of all the universe. Allah is perfect for Him alone, and there is no similarity to Him, and no one is similar to Him. You must worship Him alone.<br><br>

            Now let us know the pillars of Islam that make you Muslim:<br>
            1. Two testimonies<br>
            2. The five Prayers<br>
            3. Paying Zakat<br>
            4. Fasting in Ramadan<br>
            5. Hajj<br><br>

            Fourth is Fasting in Ramadan. Ramadan is a Hijri Month when you must stop eating and drinking from Fajr to Maghreb and where there is a night called Night of Al-Qadr. Whoever wins it is better for him than a thousand months.<br>

            <h3>Aqida (Muslim believe)</h3>
            The Muslim believes in Allah the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Master of everything in existence. The Lord of Ibrahim. Messengers and revelations have been sent to us from the time of our father Adam to the last of the prophets, Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. He came with the final revelation. The word “رب العالمين” means Lord of the Worlds. “All that is in the heavens and all that is on earth glorifies Allah. “And He is the Mighty, the Wise” 59:1<br><br>

            Even if people do not believe in Allah and worship someone else, that does not change the fact that they are His creation and that He is the one who can guide them to the straight path (Islam) or condemn them to disbelieve in Him. Revelation after showing them that this is the truth. This is the Muslim belief.<br><br>

            
            
            <h3>Sharia (laws)</h3>
            A Muslim does not use the “benign” Sharia law in Islamic countries. Rather, but use Sharia law. Sharia is the definition of the heavenly laws that Allah has commanded us to follow such as prayer, fasting, charity, good manners, wearing the hijab, and building good relationships with the people you live with, neighbors and the elderly, are all part of Sharia. Sharia also covers governance, politics, the judicial system, law enforcement, and many other aspects of life. Islam is the way of life and it covers all the necessary matters of life so that we can live and govern ourselves to the satisfaction of Allah.<br><br>
            
            in Islam you make the rules of Allah control you in your life as you mustn't do anything forbidden or taboo, and if you think it's not freedom, so for example if your son went to market and want to eat all chocolates in market you will stop him right? then do you want him without freedom, or you know that if he do that he will hurt himself?<br><br>

            Allah created the universe and He know which things hurt us, and Allah created the world as a place of affliction and fatigue, not a place of reward.<br><br>

            <h3>Pray</h3>
            Prayers change for each country due to seasonal changes, but if you live in a region like the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa, daily prayers are set at specific times and never change. It's more about the time of day. For example: Fajr prayer before sunrise, around the time of dawn. It is not permissible to pray it as soon as the sun rises, then there is noon, afternoon, after sunset, then evening. If the time of sunrise and sunset changes, the time of prayer changes.<br><br>

            <h3>Qur'an</h3>
            In Islam holy book is Quran which is words of Allah, The Qur’an was revealed in the Arabic language in an Arab country when the Arabs were most eloquent, challenging all Arabs in its eloquence and its beautiful words, And So far, nothing like The Qur'an has been written in its eloquence and Surah is a part from Qur'an.<br><br>
            
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGuZMLhyRXg">Learn More (Someone made Surah like Qur'an?!)</a><br><br>

            Quran is not misrepresented and you can make sure of it by search about oldest Quran, it no different between it and latest Quran (except the font), and what increases your certainty is .. The Qur'an is an audio book before it is a written book and there is such a thing as permission to read the Holy Quran which is a continuous chain from the person who is proficient in reading the Qur’an to the Prophet Mohammed - Peace be upon him -<br><br>

            The Qur'an can be translated and translated into any other language in the world for people to understand what they read but Allah sent down the revelation in the Arabic language so the only Arabic language can be considered the “revelation”. Others will simply be a translation of the Qur'an. 80% of Muslims are non-Arabs but are still able to recite and understand the Qur’an and recite the Qur’an in prayer daily. However, if you want to get the full experience, you have to learn Arabic because most Islamic sources are in Arabic.<br><br>

            <h3>Zakat</h3>
            There is no tax imposed by the government at all in Islam. There should be no taxes because it is an un-Islamic concept. If a non-Muslim wishes to live under an Islamic government, he or she pays the jizya, which is a tax for non-Muslims to give them safety and security, as well as access to the same services and privileges as Muslims. As for the Muslim, he does something obligatory in Islam called zakat. Muslims are required to pay 2.5% of our wealth to the poor annually, while the jizya is much less than zakat. This makes society better and compensates for the lack of resources and privileges between the poor and the rich while lifting each other up. It is not permissible for a Muslim to take zakat from other Muslims unless he is in need of it. Therefore, there are times in history when Islamic rulers did not have poor people to feed and the population complained about who was giving alms.<br>
